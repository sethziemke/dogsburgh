Finding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh

Defining what makes the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh requires infinite wisdom and knowledge on each community. Or data. We took into account the number of firearm seizures, since guns are scary; obesity rates, which we correlated to the number of playgrounds. This is to figure our which neighbordhoods are the healthiest and see if the number of playgrounds has any effect on that. Also, playgrounds are always a wild time so there's an added bonus for those. Lastly, we took a list of the 100 most common female and male dog names and removed them from the list of dog names to see which neighborhood has the most unique dogs.

**multipliers tbd**
Each value will be weighted depending on our perceived value of them.
The multipliers are as follows:
Unique dog names: (MULT) * dogNameNumber
Obesity rate: (MULT) * obesityRate
Playground count: (MULT) * playgroundCount

The values will then be added together to calculate a total neighborhood score. The highest score determines the winner.
